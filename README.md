# F1 Race Lap Chart

A Python script that produces race lap charts for Formula One races from 2018 onwards.

It extracts the race lap times from the Race Lap Analysis and Race History Chart PDFs that the FIA produce after each event.

The script uses the [Ergast API](https://ergast.com/mrd) to look up which drivers and constructors were entered for each event. In addition to the license of this repository, please see their [terms and conditions](https://ergast.com/mrd/terms/).
